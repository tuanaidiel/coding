✅ Angular Practical Test (Beginner Level)
📝 Scenario:
Create a simple Angular component called CounterComponent that has the following:

📌 Requirements:
1. A title that says: Simple Counter
2. A counter that starts from 0
3. Two buttons:
    - Increment → increases the counter by 1
    - Decrement → decreases the counter by 1
4. The counter should not go below 0
5. Display the current counter value in the template

📂 File Structure:
You’ll be working with 2 files inside the counter component folder:

- counter.component.ts
- counter.component.html

You may assume that the component is already declared in the module.
